Database named mdata is created in mongodb. 
Three collections are made namely users, articles and comments.
a separate class DbStore is written to handle all the database operations.
validations are performed in DbStore class in each of the method as required.
Some of the crucial codes are commented out on the code itself.

During Execution
This program was tested on my windows PC and works perfectly fine.
Important points
In find command * works instead of '*'
In create command roles=[author,commenter] should be written instead of roles='[author,commenter]'
